# lavaBRSARLib
A work-in-progress library to facilitate the manipulation of BRSAR files.

This library is based heavily off of the work of other people. Special thanks to:
- Jaklub and Agoaj, as well as mstaklo, ssbbtailsfan, stickman and VILE (Sawndz, Super Sawndz)
- Soopercool101, as well as Kryal, BlackJax96, and libertyernie (BrawlLib, BrawlBox, BrawlCrate)
- Gota7 and kitlith (RhythmRevolution Documentation)
- Halley's Comet Software (VGMStream Source & Documentation, along with a varietey of other resources)

Additionally, this library directly makes use of the following code written by other people:
- VGAudioCli by Alex Barney (used for conversions between GC-ADPCM .dsp files and standard .wav files)
- Portable C++ Hashing Library by Stephan Brumme (used to provide md5 hashes in file export summaries)
